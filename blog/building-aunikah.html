  <h1>Building Aunikah: When Workers Don't Know if They're W-2 or 1099</h1>
  <div class="meta">By Amy Bray • November 19, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

  <div class="info-box">
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After years in marketplaces and EOR programs, I kept seeing the same painful pattern: people didn’t know who actually employed them, or who to ask about benefits, PTO, or payroll issues. The marketplace logo was in their inbox, the client name was on the building, the EOR was on their paystub… and none of it felt clear. So I built a chatbot that does the mental sorting for them and routes questions to the right place.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>The Problem I Kept Seeing (and Seeing, and Seeing...)</h2>
  
  <p>You know how sometimes you see the same problem over and over at different companies, and you're like, "Surely SOMEONE has solved this by now"?</p>

  <p>That was me with contingent worker confusion. At The Mom Project, at Upwork — different business models, same core mess: people placed through a marketplace or staffing/EOR partner literally did not know who employed them or who to ask about benefits.</p>

  <p>From the worker’s point of view, it kind of makes sense:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The job posting was on the <strong>marketplace</strong> website</li>
    <li>The interview felt like it was with the <strong>client</strong></li>
    <li>Onboarding emails came from the <strong>marketplace domain or an EOR/staffing partner</strong></li>
    <li>They signed a stack of documents from an <strong>EOR/staffing partner</strong> they might never think about again</li>
    <li>Then they go to work every day at the client site or in the client’s Slack</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So when something goes wrong or they just need a basic answer, they do the most human thing possible: they contact the brand they remember and trust. That’s usually the marketplace.</p>

  <p>The conversation went like this about 100 times:</p>

  <p><strong>Worker:</strong> "Hey, what are my benefits?"<br>
  <strong>Me (marketplace / talent program rep):</strong> "Who's on your paystub?"<br>
  <strong>Worker:</strong> "Um... Employee Stand?"<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> "Great! They're your employer. Contact them for benefits."<br>
  <strong>Worker:</strong> "But I work at UnBungle and applied through your marketplace website?"<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> <em>[internal screaming]</em></p>

  <p>Some days it was the marketplace being mistaken for the employer. Other days it was the client being mistaken for the employer. Sometimes they didn’t even realize there was a third entity (the EOR) involved at all.</p>

  <p>And I get it! The whole W-2 contingent setup IS confusing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You interview with Company A (the client)</li>
    <li>You sign paperwork with Company B (the EOR or staffing agency)</li>
    <li>You apply on Company C’s website (the marketplace)</li>
    <li>You work at Company A every day</li>
    <li>Company B pays you and handles your benefits</li>
    <li>Company C runs the program and answers your emails</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No wonder everyone was confused. And 1099 contractors had their own version of the pain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some thought they should get benefits from the client or marketplace</li>
    <li>Others were asking their client manager how to invoice or handle taxes</li>
    <li>A few weren’t sure if they were W-2 or 1099 at all — they just knew they got paid somehow</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Internally, this meant a lot of “we’re not actually your employer” conversations, which never feel good. You’re trying to be kind, not make anyone feel stupid, and still redirect them to the right place while your ticket queues climb or inbox fills up.</p>

  <h2>Why Existing Tools Don't Fix This</h2>

  <p>Every company I worked at had HR portals, wikis, FAQs, onboarding docs. None of them solved this problem. Why?</p>

  <p><strong>Because to use them, you have to know what you're looking for.</strong></p>

  <p>If you don't know you're "W-2 contingent through an EOR," you can't search for "EOR benefits." You just know you work at UnBungle and you want to know about your health insurance. Or you know you filled out paperwork through a staffing agency, but all your day-to-day work and conversations happen with the client and the marketplace.</p>

  <p>The mental model mismatch is the whole problem:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Systems</strong> are organized by legal entities and policy types</li>
    <li><strong>People</strong> are thinking in terms of “who I see on Slack” and “whose logo is in my inbox”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So they end up in the wrong portal, asking the wrong team, feeling ignored or bounced around… when really, they just needed a translator for the employment triangle.</p>

  <h2>Enter: Aunikah</h2>

  <p>So I built a chatbot that meets people where they are. You don't need to know the terminology. You just tell it what you want, and it figures out the rest.</p>

  <p>The breakthrough moment was adding the <strong>"I'm not sure"</strong> option.</p>

  <p>Instead of making people choose between "W-2 Contingent" and "1099 Contractor" (terms half of them don't know, and the other half are afraid to get “wrong”), Aunikah asks:</p>

  <p><strong>"How do you get paid?"</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>💰 I receive a paycheck/paystub</li>
    <li>📄 I send invoices</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Then if they say paycheck: <strong>"Look at your paystub. Is the company name different from where you work?"</strong></p>

  <p>BOOM. Instant classification. No legal lecture, no jargon quiz — just observable reality.</p>

  <p>Then it explains what that means in plain language and routes them correctly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“This is your employer of record. They handle pay, benefits, and PTO.”</li>
    <li>“This is your client. They handle your day-to-day work.”</li>
    <li>“The marketplace you applied through runs the program and support, but they’re not your legal employer.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real User Feedback (aka My Former Team Saved Me)</h2>

  <p>I sent the first version to my former team (shoutout to Abby, Mary, Claudia). They're the best! They actually tested it and gave me honest feedback.</p>

  <p><strong>The feedback that changed everything:</strong> "The Quick Setup menu is confusing. I didn't know where to click."</p>

  <p>I had built this fancy collapsible menu at the top of the chat where you could set your classification and companies. Very efficient. Very… hidden.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the whole point of this thing is to help people who are already confused. Making them hunt for a setup menu is the opposite of that.</p>

  <p>They were totally right. So I redesigned the whole onboarding to be conversational. Now it walks you through setup step-by-step in the chat itself. It feels more like, “Let’s figure this out together,” and less like, “Fill out this form before I’ll talk to you.”</p>

  <p>This is why you test with real people. I was so deep in building mode I couldn't see the obvious UX issue.</p>

  <h3>The Team Member vs. Employee Thing</h3>

  <p>Another thing needed ironed out: terminology matters SO MUCH.</p>

  <p>I kept to referring everyone "employees" in the first draft. Then I realized:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1099 contractors aren't employees (that's literally the whole point)</li>
    <li>W-2 contingent workers ARE employees... but of the EOR, not the client or the marketplace</li>
    <li>"Worker" is technically accurate but feels kind of cold and transactional</li>
    <li>"Talent" is cute but overloaded in marketplace branding</li>
    <li>"Employee" is legally wrong half the time and confusing the other half</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So inside the chatbot itself, I use <strong>"team member"</strong> when I’m talking about people as humans on a team, and I switch to "employee," "contractor," or "W-2 contingent" only when we’re in legal/benefits territory and it actually matters.</p>

  <p>It seems small, but for people who already feel “less than” because they’re contingent, language is part of the experience. I didn’t want the tool that’s supposed to help them to also be the thing that makes them feel othered.</p>

  <h2>The Manager Side (aka The Database Trick)</h2>

  <p>One of my favorite features is manager mode. Managers often don't remember which of their contingent workers is W-2 through which EOR vs. 1099. Why would they? It's not their job to track that.</p>

  <p>But it <em>is</em> their job to answer basic questions like “Can I approve this PTO?” or “Where should I send them for a benefits question?” Without context, they end up guessing or forwarding people around.</p>

  <p>So in Aunikah, managers just pick the team member's name from the list. The system "knows" (from the database) whether that person is W-2 or 1099, which EOR employs them, and which client they're at.</p>

  <p>Then when the manager asks "What are Sarah's benefits?" Aunikah responds with Sarah-specific info:</p>

  <p><em>"Sarah Chen is a W-2 Contingent Worker employed by Employee Stand and working at UnBungle. Benefits include health/dental/vision through Employee Stand's plan, 401(k) with 4% match, and 15 days of PTO..."</em></p>

  <p>No more "uh, which one is she again?" The system handles it. The manager just has to care and ask.</p>

  <p>In production, this would be an API call to your HRIS. In the demo, it's just a JavaScript object. But the concept is the same: make it easy for managers to support their teams without having to memorize everyone's employment status or vendor setup.</p>

  <h2>What I Learned (The Messy Bits)</h2>

  <h3>1. Scope creep is real and I almost went global</h3>

  <p>At one point I was like "ooh, I should add international classifications! W-8BEN forms! VAT!"</p>

  <p>Then I caught myself. This is a DEMO. US-only is fine. The point is to show I understand the problem, not to solve every global employment classification scenario.</p>

  <p>Sometimes done is better than perfect. (I'm still learning this one.)</p>

  <h3>2. The paystub trick is major in solving the classification question</h3>

  <p>When people are confused about their classification, asking them to look at their paystub or how they are paid is magic. It's physical proof they can hold in their hands (or open on their phone). No ambiguity. That company name is the answer.</p>

  <p>For marketplaces, it’s also a gentle way to say, “I know you interacted with us a lot, but legally, <em>this</em> is who employs you” without making them feel silly.</p>

  <h3>3. Personalization makes it feel real</h3>

  <p>When Aunikah says "Benefits for Sarah Chen are handled by Employee Stand" instead of "Benefits are handled by their EOR," it feels custom-built. Like the system actually knows them.</p>

  <p>Same for managers: “This is a 1099 contractor; don’t promise PTO” lands differently than a generic HR blurb.</p>

  <p>That's what makes demos compelling—it feels like it could actually work in production.</p>

  <h2>Tech Stack (aka I Kept It Simple)</h2>

  <p>This is a single HTML file. Yes, really.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)</li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> JavaScript objects (in production: API calls to HRIS and vendor systems)</li>
    <li><strong>AI:</strong> Claude Sonnet 4 (for helping me design and iterate — the chatbot itself uses pattern matching, not live LLM calls)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I built this in one weekend after working with Claude to iterate on the concept. Could I have used React? Sure. Did I need to? Nope.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one.</p>

  <h2>The Stats (What This Could Do)</h2>

  <p>These are directional, based on the kinds of tickets and patterns I’ve seen over the years—not a formal study, but a realistic picture of impact if you wire this into your actual systems.</p>

  <div class="stats-grid">
    <div class="stat-card">
      <div class="stat-number">40–60%</div>
      <div class="stat-label">Reduction in HR and marketplace support tickets about “who do I ask?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stat-card">
      <div class="stat-number">100%</div>
      <div class="stat-label">Of benefit enrollment confusion routed to the correct employer/EOR</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stat-card">
      <div class="stat-number">2 min</div>
      <div class="stat-label">Average time for a team member to get a clear, personalized answer</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>What's Next</h2>

  <p>Honestly? I'm proud of this thing. It solves a real problem I saw across 13 years in People Ops and marketplace/EOR programs.</p>

  <p>If I were to take it to production, here's what would need to happen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integration with HRIS systems (Workday, BambooHR, etc.)</li>
    <li>Real EOR/vendor data feeds</li>
    <li>SSO authentication and role-aware views (team member vs manager vs HR)</li>
    <li>Actual AI/NLP for better intent detection (right now it's pattern matching)</li>
    <li>Company-specific customization (actual benefits plans, portal links, escalation paths)</li>
    <li>Analytics dashboard for HR and program teams (what people are confused about, where they’re getting stuck)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But as a portfolio piece? As proof that I understand contingent workforce operations and marketplaces, and can build solutions instead of just writing docs about them? It does exactly what it needs to do.</p>

  <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
  
  <p>The demo is live and you can play with it right now. Try the "I'm not sure" flow—it's my favorite part, because it mirrors so many real conversations I’ve had with actual humans who just wanted a straight answer.</p>
